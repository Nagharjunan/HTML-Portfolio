                In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, the
                importance of creating websites that adapt seamlessly across
                various devices cannot be overstated. With the proliferation of
                smartphones, tablets, and laptops of various screen sizes, it's
                crucial for websites to be responsive, ensuring optimal user
                experience regardless of the device being used. One of the
                fundamental tools in achieving responsive design is CSS media
                queries.

                what the range property offers, how it functions, and explore
                practical examples to illustrate its potential for creating
